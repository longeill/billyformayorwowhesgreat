  <h2><b>kink</b>s</h2>
  <p>here (there's no line break after this tag, but there is a paragraph tag after it. We'll see what happens.)</p>
  <p>totally hilarious
    <br>very funny
    <br>is this working correctly?
    <br>  do tabs work with no html input? If so then this line is indented.
    <br>does word wrap work on web pages? who knows, I've been out of the game for so long that it's anybody's guess. I bet you can't wait for this site to look better. If I keep typing here we should have a pretty good idea of what will happen, I mean, you'll know instantly. When <i>I<i> update it, that's when I'll find out. You already know though. I hope it automatically shrinks with the size of the page but I'm pretty certain it won't. If it does, well that's just dandy. If it doesn't, I don't mind learning another tag. It won't break my heart. It's only 1 more tag. (I'm putting a line break tag right after this sentence dead in the middle of the wall of text I've typed up here. I'm curious to see if it'll work. I typed all of this after typing the wall, so if it's out of place, there you go. Now you understand)<br>  (tabbed right here as well.) On top of the thousands of others. Are they even called tags? You bet your sweet ass they aren't. That's something else I'm nearly positive of as well, but it's not something I'm willing to take to Google to find out right now. If you're interested in that, then that's on you. Is (alligator mouth right)s(alligator mouth left) a <s>strikethrough</s> command? You should know, but again, I'm just finding this stuff out.
      <br>here's another break. There's a tab before this break on Atom. I don't know why.
      <br>another break.
      <br>and one more.
    <br>I tabbed it back in. I needed to reign it in before it got crazy. I don't need all that obsessive indentation bullshit. My monitor is vertical right now. Do you know what a pain in the ass it would be if I had to scroll sideways to get to everything on this html file? A major one. That's what.
    <br>one more break for fun
    <h3>Is this directly under "one more break for fun?"<br>If so, that's disgusting, but also understandable, since HTML is archaic.
      <br>it indented again.
    </p>

    <br><br><br><p>(3 line breaks here) How many kilobytes am I at right now anyway? My geocities account only lets me use so much before it starts warning me. </p>
